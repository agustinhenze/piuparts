# * For uninstallable *broken* packages we usually run the normal
#   installation+purge tests (which will fail and get the package marked
#   as bugged) and only skip the distupgrade tests since there is no point
#   in upgrading something that could not be installed as a start.
#   Automatically marking the upgrade logs as bugged would also be more
#   difficult, since the bug is in some *old* version.
# * For packages requiring *external resources* not available in piuparts
#   we usually skip the failing initial install, too, since that is
#   *not a bug* in the package.
