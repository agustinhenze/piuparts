Subject: fails to upgrade from 'stretch' - trying to overwrite ...

Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'stretch'.
It installed fine in 'stretch', then the upgrade to 'buster' fails
because it tries to overwrite other packages files without declaring a
Breaks+Replaces relation.

See policy 7.6 at
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-replaces

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
