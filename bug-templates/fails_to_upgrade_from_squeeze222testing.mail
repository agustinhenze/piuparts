Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'squeeze' to 'wheezy' to 'jessie' to stretch to buster..
It installed fine in 'squeeze', and upgraded to 'wheezy', 'jessie', and
'stretch' successfully,
but then the upgrade to 'buster' failed.

In case the package was not part of an intermediate stable release,
the version from the preceding stable release was kept installed.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
